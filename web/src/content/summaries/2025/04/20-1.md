Good morning! Hope you're starting the day with a smile.

It's Easter Sunday today! Wishing a happy one to all who are celebrating. Looks like festivities are happening worldwide, with the [Pope blessing crowds](https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cg5qmgdlgr8o) and the [UK royals joining for a service](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqr1v51l9vo). Even [Zelenskyy shared an Easter message](https://reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1k3kx9g/evil_may_have_its_hour_but_god_will_have_his_day/).

Here's a quick peek at what's making headlines:

**Around the World & Tech:**

*   Some tricky international waters with [Ukraine and Russia trading blame](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3ge7j92zo) over an 'Easter truce' and news about an [IDF inquiry into the killing of Gaza medics](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24q6201d8yo).
*   [RAF jets were busy intercepting Russian aircraft](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2y515gzq7o) near Nato airspace.
*   In legal tech news, [mass phone tracking via cell tower dumps was ruled unconstitutional](https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1k3cx8k), which is a win for privacy!
*   A judge ruled [Google built an illegal ad monopoly](https://reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1k3kpdu/judge_rules_google_built_illegal_ad_monopoly_doj/), and the DOJ might be considering breakups.
*   A word to the wise: a study suggests [men underestimate each other's willingness to seek help for depression](https://reddit.com/r/science/comments/1k359it/men_underestimate_each_others_willingness_to_seek/) – maybe time for more open chats?

**Science & Fun Bits:**

*   Fascinating science alert: [North America is apparently sinking into the Earth's mantle](https://reddit.com/r/science/comments/1k358hm/north_america_is_sinking_down_into_the_earths/)! Don't worry, it's a geological time scale thing.
*   Good news for those with a bit of scruff: [Young men with light stubble are perceived as more attractive and trustworthy](https://reddit.com/r/science/comments/1k35tws/young_men_with_light_stubble_were_perceived_as/) in experiments.
*   Ever wanted to guess when a photo was taken? Check out [Which year](https://whichyr.com/)!
*   For the techy folks, there's a cool [Raspberry Pi Lidar Scanner project](https://github.com/PiLiDAR/PiLiDAR) and an [AI that turns GitHub codebases into tutorials](https://github.com/The-Pocket/Tutorial-Codebase-Knowledge).

**Uplifting Corner:**

*   Sending congrats to a [10-year-old girl set to be the youngest grad in a California college](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1k36gpi/10yearold_girl_set_to_be_the_youngest_grad_in_a/) with two associate degrees! Wow!
*   A [huge rabbit rescued from a kill farm is now a therapy bunny and drives a mini truck](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1k39aun/huge_rabbit_rescued_from_kill_farm_is_now_therapy/)! Yes, you read that right.
*   The [UK is doubling down on wind energy](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1k3lqmc/the_uk_is_doubling_down_on_wind_energy/) – good news for renewables!
*   An amazing [Sherpa guide is attempting Everest for the 31st time](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1k3m3tm/famed_sherpa_guide_will_attempt_to_climb_mount/) to break his own record. Incredible!
*   [MIT engineers have created robotic insects that mimic pollinators](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1k36519/mit_engineers_create_robotic_insects_that_mimic/) and another MIT-founded group is working on [equipping living cells with logic gates to fight cancer](https://reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/comments/1k37dcv/equipping_living_cells_with_logic_gates_to_fight/). Science for good!

**On the personal agenda:** Looks like a good day for some exercise with a planned endurance/strength swim workout covering 2400m. Get those lengths in!

Have a fantastic Sunday!
